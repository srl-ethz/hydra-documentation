X Carriage and Toolchanger
################################

For the X-carriage assembly you will need:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2x \SI{28}{mm} spacers
    \item 2x Machined X Carriage Plate
    \item 1x 3D printed Top Block
    \item 1x Tensioning System (8 parts)
    \item Standoffs
    \item 2x M3x40 caphead screw
    \item 4x M3 locking nut
    \item 4x M3x6 countersunk screw
    \item 6x M3x6 countersunk screw
    \item 2x M3x10 countersunk screw
    \item 4x M3x16 caphead screw
    \item 1x microswitch endstop
\end{itemize}

First attach the four \SI{8}{mm} inner thread spacers to the plates by attaching the four M3x6 countersunk screws as shown.

Next attach the two plates together using the \SI{28}{mm} spacers in between the plates, and the other four \SI{8}{mm} spacers to hold them in place. 

Make sure the parts of the tensioning system slot into each other and slide all the way in.  

Insert two m3 locking nuts into the tensioner slide as shown.

Attach the brackets to one side of the assembly. 

Insert the two M3x10 countersunk screws. These are later used for tensioning the belts.

Attach the top block to the X carriage using four M3x16 caphead screws. 

Attach the microswitch to the top block using two M3x6mm caphead screws.

Attach the assembly to the topblock, using the two M3x40 caphead screws and two M3 locking nuts.

Insert the belts into the sliders.

Insert the sliders into the tensioner blocks and insert them, turning the tensioning screws, just until the threads catch.

Pretension the belts and clamp them in place on the front part of the carriage by attaching the tensioning plates with four M3x6 countersunk screws.

Finish tensioning by pulling in the tensioning slides using the M3x10 screws.

Next up the toolchanger assembly.\\
For the toolchanger assembly you will need the parts provided with the E3D toolchanger, the machined shaft, and the printed toolchanger cover. Please follow the installation guide "08 - Toolchanger Toolhead Installation" found \href{https://e3d-online.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402640504081-ToolChanger-Motion-System-Assembly-Guides}{on the E3D website} up until step 36.
