Loading Material
################################

To load filament into a filament printing head, first, select the tool and heat it up to the temperature needed for the filament. Push the clamp on the Hemera extruder back and insert the filament between the gears. Continue to push down the filament, until a little bit is extruded through the nozzle. Alternatively, you can clamp the filament between the gears and while the tool is active use the extrude button in the duet web interface to extrude a little material. It is recommended to use either a speed of 1 or 5 mm/s.

To load pellets, select the tool and heat it up to the temperature needed for the material. Insert the pellets into the hopper on the side. Use the "prime pellet head" macro on the right side of the Duet web interface. After 150 seconds slowly extrude 10mm at a time using the buttons on the Duet Web interface, until some material is extruded through the nozzle.
