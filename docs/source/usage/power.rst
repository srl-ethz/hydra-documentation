Powering Up and Connecting
################################

Power up the Raspberry Pi by connecting its power supply to power. After a few seconds, power on the rest of the machine by flipping the main power switch in the back of the machine. The last power switch turns on the power for the heated bed. The heated bed will stay inactive until prompted by the web interface or gcode.
The Raspberry Pi should automatically connect to your WiFi network. If this is not the case, please make sure you followed the steps in section "Firmware and Slicer" under "building Instructions" until the end. If you are connecting to the Raspberry Pi via Ethernet, make sure to connect the cable before powering up the Raspberry Pi.

Open your preferred browser on your computer and type in ADRESS. The duet web interface will show up. 

.. Caution:: If the web interface does not show all hotends, you might need to restart the RepRap Firmware, by clicking on "Emergency Stop" in the top right corner.

If you are unable to connect to the printer, scan you network for the IP adress of the Raspberry Pi and double check that you are using the correct IP adress to attempt to connect to it.
