Preheating and Swapping Tools
################################

To Preheat a tool, simply enter the desired temperature or select it from the drop down menu in the passive box in the Duet web interface. Then click on the "Preheat Hotend" macro on the right side of the interface. 

.. note::  If the tool is currently active, this will deselect it. When the tool is selected, the active temperature will be set.
  
To select a tool simply click on the name of the tool in the Duet web interface. If another tool is currently selected, it will be deselected first. This will heat up the selected tool to its active temperature (And cool down the deselected tool to its passive temperature).
To fully turn off a hot end click on the heater name, while the tool is in its passive state.
