Toolchanger Parts
==================

The Hydra MK1 assembly requires two different machined parts. One has to be lathed, the other can be milled or cut by waterjet.

TC Plate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please find the technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder. You will need two identical parts, milled or cut from 2mm aluminium plates with general tolerances (ISO 2768-1). If your supplier offers taping as a service, you can add M3 taps to the outer four holes that have a 2.5mm diameter. Otherwise, you will have to tap these holes yourself. Make sure the two 3.2mm holes second from the top are countersunk, so an M3 screw sits flush with the top as shown in the figure below.

TC Shaft
^^^^^^^^^^^

Please find the technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder. You will need a single shaft machined out of steel 1.4301 with general tolerances (ISO 2768-1).

Electronics mounting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please find the .dxf files for the electronics mounting in the machined parts folder. These four parts need to be cut out of 4mm thick PMMA sheets. We recommend using a non translucent PMMA for a visually pleasing finish.


V4 Pellet Extruder
===================

If you are planning on using a V4 Pellet Extruder in your machine, you will need to machine an additional part for each pellet extruder you are using. You can find the "V4_Pellet_Clamp" technical drawing and step file in the machined parts folder. The part can be made from aluminium with general tolerances (ISO 2768-1).
