Printed Parts

For the Motion System and tool changer you will need to print the following parts. It is recommended to print several parts in PETG as they will either be exposed to raised temperatures or mechanical stress. The other parts can also be printed in PETG or a material that is easier to print such as PLA. Optimal orientation and support structures can be found in the TC.3mf file. If you are using a different cable brace, please adapt the "TC Top Block" and "" parts.

============================= ===================

After the parts are printed, remove any support material.

Make sure your cable brace fits in the slots. If not, you can either clear the slots with an Exacto knife or heat the metal strip and insert it into the recess. Check whether M3 screws can fit into the 3.2mm holes of the parts. If they bind up, you can drill open these holes with a 3.2mm or 3mm drill bit.

.. Attention:: Some holes are meant to be taped into. Namely the mounting holes for TC receiver plates and the securing holes for the cable brace. Do not drill open these holes!
