Unclogging Pellet Extruder
################################

If the pellet extruder is clogges, first try to remove any material from the chamber and extrude some material on the slowest speed. 

If this fails, try raising the temperature by 10-20 degrees (assuming the material is not flammable or deteriorates at said temperatures) and try to extrude some material.

If this fails, remove the nozzle from the extruder and try the same procedure.

If the pellet extruder is still clogged, you will have to take it apart, to clean the extruder screw. This will take between 30 and 60 minutes.

To take appart the V4 Pellet Extruder please follow the assembly guide in reverse order, until both aluminium brackets are removed. The Extruder should now look like this:

Now unscrew the four M3 bolts holding the small aluminium plate around the main brass tube.

After removing the tube you should be able to slide the brass tube off of the extruder screw.

Be careful to not damage the heatcartridge and/or the thermistor. When you have to excert larger forces to remove the clogg, it could make sense to remove the heating block, to prevent damage.
