Calibrating Tool Offsets
################################

This guide assumes you have calibrated your parking spots already. We will calibrate the tool offsets in two sections. First the Z offset will be determined. After that the X and Y offset will be set.

Z - Offset
================

Home all axis of the printer. Move the bed down by roughly 100mm. Make sure that the current Z offset values are 0 (Described below). Select the tool you are trying to calibrate.
Move it to the middle of the printbed (Roughly X200 Y200). Place a piece of paper on the bed and slowly move up the bed. As soon as the nozzle of the printhead catches the paper, stop and note down the current Z coordinate. Move the bed out of the way and park the tool.




X/Y - Offset
================

First by eye with dot, then with print
